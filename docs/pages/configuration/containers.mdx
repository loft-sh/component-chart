Components are deployed as Kubernetes Deployment or StatefulSet (if one of the containers mounts a value). These Kubernetes resources create a certain number of pods which are a set of containers. These containers are created based on images. 

## `name`
The `name` option is optional and expects a string with the name for the Container.

#### Default Value for `name`
```yaml
name: container-[index]
```

## `image`
The `image` option is mandatory and expects a string with the image repository (optionally including an image tag).

#### Example: Set `image` for containers
```yaml
containers:
- image: dscr.io/username/my-backend-image
- image: nginx:1.15
```
The example above would create a pod with two containers:

1. The first container would be create from the image `dscr.io/username/my-backend-image`
2. The second container would be created from the `nginx` image on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com) which is tagged as version `1.15`


## `command`
The `command` option is optional and expects an array of strings. This option is used to override the `ENTRYPOINT` specified in the Dockerfile.

#### Example: Set `command` and `args` for containers
```yaml
containers:
- image: dscr.io/username/api-server
  command:
  - sleep
  args:
  - 9999999
```
The above example would start the container effectively with the following process: `sleep 9999999`

For more information, please take a look at the [Kubernetes documentation for setting command and args](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/inject-data-application/define-command-argument-container/).


## `args`
The `args` option is optional and expects an array of strings. This option is used to override the `CMD` specified in the Dockerfile.


## `stdin`
The `stdin` option is optional and expects a boolean which defines if stdin should be enabled for this container.


## `tty`
The `tty` option is optional and expects a boolean which defines if tty should be enabled for this container.


## `env`
The `env` option is optional and expects an array of environment variables for this container. 

`env.name` specifies the name of the environment variable.

The value of an environment variable is defined either:

1. By directly inserting the value via `env.value`
2. By referencing a key within a secret via `env.valueFrom.secretKeyRef`
3. By referencing a key within a configMap via `env.valueFrom.configMapKeyRef`
4. By using any other field supported for `env.valueFrom` as defined by the [Kubernetes specification for `v1.EnvVarSource`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.13/#envvarsource-v1-core)

:::tip
Instead of storing configuration data (e.g. database host, username and password) inside your Docker image, you should define such information as environment variables.
:::

#### Example: Set `env` for containers
```yaml
containers:
- image: "dscr.io/username/mysql"
  env:
  - name: MYSQL_USER
    value: "my_user"
  - name: MYSQL_PASSWORD
    value: "my-secret-passwd"
```
The above example would set two environment variables, `MYSQL_USER="my_user"` and `MYSQL_PASSWORD="my-secret-passwd"` within the first container of the `database` component.


#### Reference: `env`
```yaml
name: [a-z0-9-]{1,253}      # Name of the environment variable
value: [string]             # Option 1: Set static value for the environment variable
valueFrom:                  # Option 2: Load value from another resource
  secretKeyRef:             # Option 2.1: Use the content of a Kubernetes secret as value
    name: [secret-name]     # Name of the secret
    key: [key-name]         # Key within the secret
  configMapKeyRef:          # Option 2.2: Use the content of a Kubernetes configMap as value
    name: [configmap-name]  # Name of the config map
    key: [key-name]         # Key within the config map
```

## `volumeMounts`
The `volumeMounts` option excepts an array of volumes which should be mounted into this container.

### `containerPath`
The `containerPath` option expects a string with a path that defines where the volume should be mounted within the container.

#### Example: Mounting Volumes
```yaml
containers:
- image: "dscr.io/username/mysql"
  volumeMounts:
  - containerPath: /var/lib/mysql
    volume:
      name: mysql-data
      subPath: /mysql
      readOnly: false
volumes:
- name: mysql-data
  size: "5Gi"
```
The example above would create a volume called `mysql-data` for the component `my-component` and mount the folder `/mysql` within this volume into the path `/var/lib/mysql` within a container of this component.

By mounting this volume to `/var/lib/mysql`, you allow the container to edit the files and folder contained within `/var/lib/mysql` and restart without losing these changes.

### `volume.name`
The `volume.name` option is mandatory and expects a string with the name of the volume that should be mounted.

### `volume.subPath`
The `volume.subPath` option is optional and expects a string with a path within the volume that should be mounted into the container.

### `volume.readOnly`
The `volume.readOnly` option expects a boolean which defines if the volume should be mounted in read-only mode.

#### Default for `volume.readOnly`
```yaml
readOnly: false
```

### `volume.shared`
The `volume.shared` option expects a boolean which defines if the volume should be shared between pods.

#### Default for `volume.shared`
```yaml
shared: false
```

## `resources`
The `resources` section of a container allows you to configure resource restrictions for this container.

#### Types of Resources
You can set resource limits and resource requests for the following resources:
- CPU in Core units, i.e. 3 = 3 Cores, 800m = 0.8 Core (=800 **M**illi-Core)
- Memory (RAM) in Gi (Gigabyte), Mi (Megabyte) or Ki (Kilobyte)
- Emphemeral (non-persistent container) storage in Gi (Gigabyte), Mi (Megabyte) or Ki (Kilobyte)

### `limits`
To limit the resources of a container, simply configure the `limits` within the `resources` section of the container.
```yaml
containers:
- image: dscr.io/username/api-server
  resources:
    limits:
      cpu: 400m
      memory: 500Mi
      ephemeralStorage: 2Gi
```
The above example would define that this container can use a maximum of:
- 0.4 Cores
- 500 Megabytes of Memory (RAM)
- 2 Gigabytes of ephemeral storage

:::warning
Resource limits should always be higher than the resource requests. Because resource limits are not allocated/reserved for a container (unlike resource requests), it is possible to oversubscribe resource limits, i.e. use a total of resource limits over all containers which is more than the cluster has.
:::

### `requests`
To allocate/reserve resources for a container, simply configure the `requests` within the `resources` section of the container.
```yaml
containers:
- image: dscr.io/username/api-server
  resources:
    requests:
      cpu: 200m
      memory: 300Mi
      ephemeralStorage: 1Gi
```
The above example would define that this container can use a maximum of:
- 0.2 Cores
- 300 Megabytes of Memory (RAM)
- 1 Gigabytes of ephemeral storage


## `livenessProbe`
The `livenessProbe` option is optional and expects a [Kubernetes livenessProbe](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/).


## `readinessProbe`
The `readinessProbe` option is optional and expects a [Kubernetes readinessProbe](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/).


## `startupProbe`
The `startupProbe` option is optional and expects a [Kubernetes startupProbe](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/).
