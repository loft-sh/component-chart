title: Headless Service (StatefulSet)
sidebar_label: serviceName
---

The `serviceName` option expects a string that will be used as a name for the headless service if the component will be deployed as a StatefulSet instead of a Deployment. This happens automatically when one of the containers mounts a persistent volume.

#### Default Value For `serviceName`
```yaml
serviceName: "[COMPONENT_NAME]-headless"
```

#### Example: Custom Name for Headless Service
```yaml
containers:
- image: mysql
  volumeMounts:
  - containerPath: /var/lib/mysql
    volume:
      name: mysql-data
      subPath: /mysql
      readOnly: false
volumes:
- name: mysql-data
  size: "5Gi"
serviceName: "custom-name-for-headless-service"
```
**Explanation:**  
Instead of the default name `backend-headless`, the headless service for the ReplicaSet created by this component would be `custom-name-for-headless-service`.
