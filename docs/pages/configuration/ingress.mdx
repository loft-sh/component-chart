<FragmentIngressExample/>

## `rules`
The `rules` option expects an array of ingress rules that define how the incoming external traffic is routed by the ingress.

## `disabled`
The `disabled` option can be set to `true` to disable the ingress without removing the rules definitions.
In devspace it can be configured by a environmental variable or flag.

### `host`
The `host` option expects a string stating the hostname (domain name) that the component should be made available on.

:::note
The component chart automatically makes sure that all hosts specified via `ingress.rules[].host` are connected to the `service` of the component.
:::

:::info Multiple Ports
If the `service` of this component defines multiple `ports`, the component chart will use the first one unless you specify the [`servicePort` option](#serviceport).
:::

#### Example: Defining Hosts
```yaml
containers:
- image: dscr.io/${DEVSPACE_USERNAME}/appfrontend
service:
  ports:
  - port: 3000
ingress:
  rules:
  - host: my-static-host.tld
  - host: other-domain.tld
```


### `path`
The `path` option expects a URL path which is used for routing. Only requests to this `path` will be forwarded to the service of this component.

#### Default Value For `path`
```yaml
path: /
```

#### Example: Defining Ingress Paths
```yaml
containers:
- image: dscr.io/${DEVSPACE_USERNAME}/appfrontend
service:
  ports:
  - port: 3000
ingress:
  rules:
  - host: my-static-host.tld
    path: /login
```

### `pathType`
Since v1.18.0 of kubernetes each path in an Ingress is required to have a corresponding [path type](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/#path-types)

There are three supported path types:
- `ImplementationSpecific`: With this path type, matching is up to the IngressClass. Implementations can treat this as a separate pathType or treat it identically to Prefix or Exact path types.
- `Exact`: Matches the URL path exactly and with case sensitivity.
- `Prefix`: Matches based on a URL path prefix split by /. Matching is case sensitive and done on a path element by element basis. A path element refers to the list of labels in the path split by the / separator. A request is a match for path p if every p is an element-wise prefix of p of the request path.

#### Example: Defining Ingress Path type
```yaml
containers:
- image: dscr.io/${DEVSPACE_USERNAME}/appfrontend
service:
  ports:
  - port: 3000
ingress:
  rules:
  - host: my-static-host.tld
    path: /login
    pathType: Prefix
```

### `servicePort`
The `servicePort` option expects an integer stating the port of the service to which the traffic should be routed for the hostname stated in `host`.

:::info Multiple Ports
By default, the ingress will automatically route to the first port specified under `service.ports` within this component.
:::

#### Example: Custom Service Port
```yaml
containers:
- image: dscr.io/${DEVSPACE_USERNAME}/appfrontend
service:
  ports:
  - port: 3000
  - port: 8000
ingress:
  rules:
  - host: my-static-host.tld
    servicePort: 8000
```


### `serviceName`
The `serviceName` option expects a string stating the name of the Kubernetes service to which the traffic should be routed for the hostname stated in `host`.

:::note
By default, the ingress will automatically route to the service defined in the `service` section within this component. Defining `serviceName` is generally only useful if you want to create a simple ingress for another service that has not been created by a component, e.g. from using one of the Helm charts from the stable repository.
:::

:::warning
If `serviceName` is defined, `servicePort` must also be defined.
:::

#### Example: Custom Service Name
```yaml
containers:
- image: dscr.io/${DEVSPACE_USERNAME}/appfrontend
ingress:
  rules:
  - host: my-static-host.tld
    serviceName: my-custom-k8s-service
    servicePort: 8000
```
**Explanation:**
This example configuration would only create an ingress for a service called `my-custom-k8s-service` and forward the traffic from `my-static-host.tld` to port `8000` of this service.


## `tls`
The `tls` option expects either:
- a string stating the name of a Kubernetes secret which contains the TLS certificate to use for SSL
- a boolean to enable/disable TLS (an auto-generated name of a secret will be created referencing a Kubernetes secret containing the TLS certificate to use for SSL)

#### Default Value For `tls`
```yaml
tls: false
```

#### Example: Enabling TLS for Ingress
```yaml
containers:
- image: dscr.io/${DEVSPACE_USERNAME}/appfrontend
service:
  ports:
  - port: 3000
ingress:
  tls: true
  rules:
  - host: my-static-host.tld
  - host: my-static-host2.tld
```

## `tlsClusterIssuer`
The `tlsClusterIssuer` option expects a string with the name of the cluster issuer for cert-manager.

#### Default Value For `tlsClusterIssuer`
```yaml
tlsClusterIssuer: lets-encrypt-http-issuer
```

#### Example: Custom Cluster Issuer
```yaml
containers:
- image: dscr.io/${DEVSPACE_USERNAME}/appfrontend
service:
  ports:
  - port: 3000
ingress:
  tls: true
  tlsClusterIssuer: staging-issuer
  rules:
  - host: my-static-host.tld
  - host: my-static-host2.tld
```

## `ingressClassName`
The `ingressClassName` option expects a string with a Kubernetes ingress class used for a cert-manager annotation.

#### Default Value For `ingressClassName`
```yaml
ingressClassName: nginx
```

#### Example: Custom Ingress Class
```yaml
containers:
- image: dscr.io/${DEVSPACE_USERNAME}/appfrontend
service:
  ports:
  - port: 3000
ingress:
  ingressClassName: traefik
  tls: true
  rules:
  - host: my-static-host.tld
  - host: my-static-host2.tld
```


## `name`
The `name` option is optional and expects a string that will be used as a name for the ingress that is being created for this component.

#### Example: Custom Name for Ingress
```yaml
containers:
- image: dscr.io/${DEVSPACE_USERNAME}/appfrontend
service:
  ports:
  - port: 3000
ingress:
  name: custom-ingress-name
  tls: true
  rules:
  - host: my-static-host.tld
  - host: my-static-host2.tld
```
**Explanation:**
Instead of the default name `frontend`, the ingress of this component would be named `custom-ingress-name`.


## `labels`
The `labels` option expects a map with Kubernetes labels.

By default, the component chart sets a couple of labels following the best practices described in the Kubernetes documentation:
- `app.kubernetes.io/name: devspace-app`
- `app.kubernetes.io/component: [DEPLOYMENT_NAME]`

:::note
You can specify additional labels using the `labels` option but the default / best practice labels will still be set for the component.
:::

All additional labels will be added to the ingress created for this component.

#### Default Value For `labels`
```yaml
labels: []
```

#### Example: Additional Labels
```yaml
containers:
- image: dscr.io/${DEVSPACE_USERNAME}/appfrontend
service:
  ports:
  - port: 3000
ingress:
  tls: true
  rules:
  - host: my-static-host.tld
  - host: my-static-host2.tld
  labels:
    label1: label-value-1
    label2: label-value-2
```


## `annotations`
The `annotations` option expects a map with Kubernetes annotations.

By default, the component chart sets a couple of annotations following the best practices described in the Kubernetes documentation:
- `helm.sh/chart: component-chart-vX.Y.Z`

:::note
You can specify additional annotations using the `annotations` option but the default / best practice annotations will still be set for the component.
:::

All additional annotations will be added to the ingress created for this component.

#### Default Value For `annotations`
```yaml
annotations: []
```

#### Example: Additional Annotations
```yaml
containers:
- image: dscr.io/${DEVSPACE_USERNAME}/appfrontend
service:
  ports:
  - port: 3000
ingress:
  tls: true
  rules:
  - host: my-static-host.tld
  - host: my-static-host2.tld
  annotations:
    annotation1: annotation-value-1
    annotation2: annotation-value-2
```
